Description:
🚀 Welcome to the RestfulAPI-Basics-Learning repository! 🌐

This project serves as a practical demonstration of my journey into the fundamentals of building RESTful APIs. As I delved into the world of web development, I created this project to solidify my understanding of RESTful principles and hone my skills in handling HTTP requests, designing endpoints, and managing data.

📋 **Key Features:**
1. **Endpoint Design:** Explore a well-thought-out structure for defining endpoints, reflecting the RESTful architecture.
2. **CRUD Operations:** Experience the implementation of Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations to interact with resources.
3. **Data Validation:** Learn how to validate incoming data to ensure the integrity and security of your API.
4. **Error Handling:** Discover robust error-handling mechanisms for providing meaningful responses in case of unexpected situations.
5. **Documentation:** Find detailed documentation to guide you through the API, making it easy to understand and integrate into your projects.

🛠️ **Tech Stack:**
- **Backend:** Utilizes [your chosen backend technology and framework].
- **Database:** [Specify the type of database used, if applicable].
- **API Format:** JSON-based responses for simplicity and compatibility.

📦 **Getting Started:**
